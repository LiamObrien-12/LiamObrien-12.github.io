## Liam O'Brien's CS499 Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my ePortfolio for the SNHU Computer Science Capstone. This portfolio demonstrates my growth as a developer by showcasing two enhanced software artifacts:

- **SafeHaven Banking App** – Focused on security and algorithmic efficiency
- **Weight Tracking App** – Focused on frontend engineering and user-centered design

## 📌 Featured Artifacts

### 🔐 SafeHaven Banking App
Originally created in a full-stack web development course, this app simulates a personal banking system with investment tracking. For this enhancement, I focused on the **Algorithms and Data Structures** category by:
- Implementing **AES encryption** for secure transaction storage
- Adding a **binary search algorithm** to improve investment lookup speed
- Securing routes with proper authentication and authorization checks

### 📊 Weight Tracking App
This mobile app allows users to track and visualize their weight trends over time. Originally built in Java, I improved it by:
- Redesigning the UI for responsiveness and clarity
- Adding state-saving logic for tracking weight history across sessions
- Improving backend calculations for real-time data updates
